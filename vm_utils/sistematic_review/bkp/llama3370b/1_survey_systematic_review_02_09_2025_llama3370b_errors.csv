In 2017, approximately 87,110 new cases of skin cancer were diagnosed in the United States alone. A dermatoscope is a tool that captures lesion images with high resolution and is one of the main clinical tools to diagnose, evaluate and monitor this disease. This paper presents a new approach to classify melanoma automatically using structural co-occurrence matrix (SCM) of main frequencies extracted from dermoscopy images. The main advantage of this approach consists in transform the SCM in an adaptive feature extractor improving his power of discrimination using only the image as parameter. The images were collected from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2016, 2017 and Pedro Hispano Hospital (PH2) datasets. Specificity (Spe), sensitivity (Sen), positive predictive value, F Score, Harmonic Mean, accuracy (Acc) and area under the curve (AUC) were used to verify the efficiency of the SCM. The results show that the SCM in the frequency domain work automatically, where it obtained better results in comparison with local binary patterns, gray-level co-occurrence matrix and invariant moments of Hu as well as compared with recent works with the same datasets. The results of the proposed approach were: Spe 95.23%, 92.15% and 99.4%, Sen 94.57%, 89.9% and 99.2%, Acc 94.5%, 89.93% and 99%, and AUC 92%, 90% and 99% in ISIC 2016, 2017 and PH2 datasets, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","10.1016/j.compmedimag.2018.05.004","Image classification; Machine learning; Melanoma; Structural co-occurrence matrix","45","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048624238&doi=10.1016%2fj.compmedimag.2018.05.004&partnerID=40&md5=811aa6a730757e79ac3803551ba0f064"

The analysis is based on the so-called ABCDE (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Colour variegation, Diameter, Evolution) criteria, although confirmation is obtained through biopsy performed by a pathologist. The proposed method exploits an automatic pipeline based on morphological analysis and evaluation of skin lesion dermoscopy images. Preliminary segmentation and pre-processing of dermoscopy image by SC-cellular neural networks is performed, in order to obtain ad-hoc grey-level skin lesion image that is further exploited to extract analytic innovative hand-crafted image features for oncological risks assessment. In the end, a pre-trained Levenberg-Marquardt neural network is used to perform ad-hoc clustering of such features in order to achieve an efficient nevus discrimination (benign against melanoma), as well as a numerical array to be used for follow-up rate definition and assessment.

In the field of dermatology, many a times extensive tests are to be carried out so as to decide upon the skin condition the patient may be facing. The time may vary from practitioner to practitioner. This is also based on the experience of that person too. So, there is a need of a system which can diagnose the skin diseases without any of these constraints. We propose an automated image based system for recognition of skin diseases using machine learning classification. This system will utilize computational technique to analyze, process, and relegate the image data predicated on various features of the images. Skin images are filtered to remove unwanted noise and also process it for enhancement of the image. Feature extraction using complex techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), classify the image based on the algorithm of softmax classifier and obtain the diagnosis report as an output. This system will give more accuracy and will generate results faster than the traditional method, making this application an efficient and dependable system for dermatological disease detection.

"Skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopy images via deep full resolution convolutional networks","Al-masni M.A.; Al-antari M.A.; Choi M.-T.; Han S.-M.; Kim T.-S.","2018","1","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","Background and objective: Automatic segmentation of skin lesions in dermoscopy images is still a challenging task due to the large shape variations and indistinct boundaries of the lesions. Accurate segmentation of skin lesions is a key prerequisite step for any computer-aided diagnostic system to recognize skin melanoma. Methods: In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation methodology via full resolution convolutional networks (FrCN). The proposed FrCN method directly learns the full resolution features of each individual pixel of the input data without the need for pre- or post-processing operations such as artifact removal, low contrast adjustment, or further enhancement of the segmented skin lesion boundaries. We evaluated the proposed method using two publicly available databases, the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017 Challenge and PH2 datasets. To evaluate the proposed method, we compared the segmentation performance with the latest deep learning segmentation approaches such as the fully convolutional network (FCN), U-Net, and SegNet. Results: Our results showed that the proposed FrCN method segmented the skin lesions with an average Jaccard index of 77.11% and an overall segmentation accuracy of 94.03% for the ISBI 2017 test dataset and 84.79% and 95.08%, respectively, for the PH2 dataset. In comparison to FCN, U-Net, and SegNet, the proposed FrCN outperformed them by 4.94%, 15.47%, and 7.48% for the Jaccard index and 1.31%, 3.89%, and 2.27% for the segmentation accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed FrCN achieved a segmentation accuracy of 95.62% for some representative clinical benign cases, 90.78% for the melanoma cases, and 91.29% for the seborrheic keratosis cases in the ISBI 2017 test dataset, exhibiting better performance than those of FCN, U-Net, and SegNet. Conclusions: We conclude that using the full spatial resolutions of the input image could enable to learn better specific and prominent features, leading to an improvement in the segmentation performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.05.027","Deep learning; Dermoscopy; Full resolution convolutional network (FrCN); Melanoma; Skin lesion segmentation","404","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047600387&doi=10.1016%2fj.cmpb.2018.05.027&partnerID=40&md5=18812c13cc0b21ec98c5062d3b4aad2c"

For reasons heretofore unclear, previous works have found image segmentation to be, conflictingly, both detrimental and beneficial to skin lesion classification. We investigate the effect of expanding the segmentation border to include pixels surrounding the target lesion. Ostensibly, segmenting a target skin lesion will remove inessential information, non-lesion skin, and artifacts to aid in classification. Our results indicate that segmentation border enlargement produces, to a certain degree, better results across all metrics of interest when using a convolutional based classifier built using the transfer learning paradigm.

However, if the melanoma is diagnosed in Phase I, the survival rates increase. The segmentation of the melanoma is one of the largest tasks to undertake and achieve when considering both beneath and over the segmentation. In this work, a new approach based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed for the detection of melanoma from digital images. This method is simple, fast, flexible, and requires fewer parameters compared with other algorithms. The proposed approach is applied on the PH2, ISBI 2016 challenge, the ISBI 2017 challenge, and Dermis datasets. These bases contained images are affected by different abnormalities. The formation of the databases consists of images collected from different sources; they are bases with different types of resolution, lighting, etc., so in the first step, the noise was removed from the images by using morphological filtering. In the next step, the ABC algorithm is used to find the optimum threshold value for the melanoma detection. The proposed approach achieved good results in the conditions of high specificity. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method accomplished higher performance compared to the ground truth images supported by a Dermatologist. For the melanoma detection, the method achieved an average accuracy and Jaccard's coefficient in the range of 95.24-97.61%, and 83.56-85.25% in these four databases. To show the robustness of this work, the results were compared to existing methods in the literature for melanoma detection.

Melanoma is one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, which originates from melanocytes. While other skin cancer types have limited spreading capabilities, the danger of melanoma comes from its ability to spread (metastasize) rapidly. Fortunately, it can be detected by visual inspection of the skin surface, and it is 100% curable if identified in the early stages. However, detection by “subjective visual inspection” creates an important problem, due to investigators’ different levels of experiences and education. Dermoscopy (dermatoscopy) has significantly increased the diagnostic accuracy of melanoma since late 90’s. In addition, several systems have been proposed in order to assist investigators or to perform an automatic melanoma detection.

Experimental results have been obtained by testing two network architectures on publicly available data and, in order to show that the used approach is not data set related, we have used the ISIC database for training the network and the PH2 database for testing. The results show that the proposed approach achieves a very accurate segmentation even in presence of hair and air/oil bubbles. An additional contribution of this work is the development of a semi-automatic GUI for data annotation that can be used to generate more test images. © 2018 IEEE.","10.1109/MeMeA.2018.8438669","Deep Learning Image Processing; Dermoscopy Images; Melanoma Detection; Skin Lesion Segmentation","20","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053153323&doi=10.1109%2fMeMeA.2018.8438669&partnerID=40&md5=4fc411e66fcae18e1d4a272b613a2669"

Assorted methods have been proposed in recent times including the deep learning techniques for computer based melanoma recognition. But, most of the techniques have enhanced feature dimension which has added to the computational complexity of the entire system. In this work, the authors have attempted to design robust light-weight feature extraction techniques from high level bit planes of dermoscopic images.

Clinically, dermoscopy is a routine method for early diagnosis of malignant melanoma. However, human's visual examinations are laborious, time-consuming, and highly dependent on dermatologist' s clinical experience. Therefore, it is important to design an algorithm for recognizing melanoma automatically in dermoscopy images. This study proposed a novel framework for the evaluation of dermoscopy images, using deep learning to generate more discriminative features with limited training data. Specifically, we first extracted the intermediate convolutional features of each skin lesion image using a very deep residual neural network including 152 network layers (i. e. Res-152) which was pre-trained on a large natural image dataset, and the final deep representation was obtained by averaging the spatial feature maps into single feature vector, then, the support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify the melanoma. By using the proposed method 248 melanoma images and 1031 nonmelanoma images in published ISBI 2016 challenge datasets of skin lesion images were evaluated, obtaining accuracy rate of 84.96% and AUC of 84. 18%. In addition, in order to demonstrate the effect of neural network depth on the classification results, we compared the different depth of the model framework. Our approach, which could solve large variations in melanoma and small differences between melanoma and nonmelanoma with the limited training data, can produce more discriminative representations than existing studies using hand-crafted features (i. e. the BoF models based on densely sampled SIFT (DSIFT) descriptors) or only to extract features from the fully connected layers. © 2018 Society of China University Journals in Natural Sciences.

Methods: several segmentation methods used for measuring wound geometry, including edge-detection and morphological operations, region-growing, Livewire, active contours, and texture segmentation, were compared on 26 images from 15 subjects. Ground-truth wound delineations were generated by a dermatologist. The wound coordinates were converted into G-code understandable by the bioprinting robot. Due to its desirable properties, alginate hydrogel was synthesized by dissolving 16% (w/v) sodium-alginate and 4% (w/v) gelatin in deionized water and used for cell encapsulation. Results: Livewire achieved the best performance, with minimal user interaction: 97.08%, 99.68% 96.67%, 96.22, 98.15, and 32.26, mean values, respectively, for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Jaccard index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Hausdorff distance.

This algorithm especially applies to the extraction of deep concave region of hand contour, and overcomes the problem that particle filter can not obtain accurate information. Firstly, the hand region obtained by the particle filter is grayscale enhanced by skin color, weakening the background gradient information. And then the GVF snake model, with adaptive gradient vector flow field and adaptive external guidance force improved by skin color, is introduced to extract the real contour and modify the systematic observation and system state of particle filter. In this case, it can reduce the possibility of degradation of particles and realize hand tracking more accurately.

The evolution equation incorporates a force term that pushes the contour towards object boundary, a regularisation term which takes into account the smoothness of the level set function and an edge term which helps to stop the contour at required boundaries. The proposed method integrates an image convolved by a variable kernel into an energy formulation, where the width of the kernel varies in each iteration. Therefore, it takes local region information when the width of the kernel is small while for the larger width of the kernel, the proposed method considers global region information across the regions. Due to the use of both local and global image information, the method easily detects objects in the complex background and also segments the objects where intensity changes within the object. Moreover, the proposed method totally eliminates the need of the contour initialisation by using constant initialisation scheme.

In this paper, we have focused on the most frequently mentioned problem in the field of machine learning, that is the lack of sufficient amount of the training data or uneven class balance within the datasets. One of the ways of dealing with this problem is so called data augmentation.

Next, we presented our own method of data augmentation based on image style transfer. The method allows to generate the new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of a base image with the appearance of another ones. The newly created images can be used to pre-train the given neural network in order to improve the training process efficiency.

Melanoma, the skin cancer, originates from skin layers and penetrates deep into subcutaneous layers. There exists an extensive research in melanoma diagnosis using dermatoscopic images captured through a dermatoscope. While designing a diagnostic model for general handheld imaging systems is an emerging trend, this article proposes a computer-aided decision support system for macro images captured by a general-purpose camera. General imaging conditions are adversely affected by nonuniform illumination, which further affects the extraction of relevant information. To mitigate it, we process an image to define a smooth illumination surface using the multistage illumination compensation approach, and the infected region is extracted using the proposed multimode segmentation method. The lesion information is numerated as a feature set comprising geometry, photometry, border series, and texture measures. The redundancy in feature set is reduced using information theory methods, and a classification boundary is modeled to distinguish benign and malignant samples using support vector machine, random forest, neural network, and fast discriminative mixed-membership–based naive Bayesian classifiers. Moreover, the experimental outcome is supported by hypothesis testing and boxplot representation for classification losses.

Specifically, we rely on a dermoscopic-structure-based soft segmentation to design a set of structure-specific classifiers. Each individual structure-specific classifier is trained to distinguish benign lesions from melanomas just paying attention to one type of dermoscopic structure. Then, the outputs of the individual classifiers are combined by a means of the Bayesian method that, besides the final diagnosis, provide the doctor with additional valuable information, such as the opinions of the individual structure-specific experts and the uncertainty of the diagnosis. The results in terms of the features selected for the structure-specific classifiers are consistent with the expert insights. Furthermore, regarding the automatic melanoma diagnosis problem, the proposed method has been assessed on two different datasets, and the experimental results revealed that the proposed system clearly outperforms other methods in two datasets and compares well with the official submissions of the ISBI 2016 challenge on melanoma detection. Moreover, the system performance is equivalent to that of a well-known dermoscopy expert and its combination with the human diagnosis surpasses the human performance. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","10.1007/s11042-017-4879-3","Bayesian fusion; Computer-aided diagnosis; Dermoscopic structures; Enriched diagnosis; Melanoma diagnosis","4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020743290&doi=10.1007%2fs11042-017-4879-3&partnerID=40&md5=ef7b639789f8bb696423a48ddfc2d2b4"

In this paper, a novel segmentation method of skin lesions is proposed which is both effective and simple to implement. Smoothing of skin lesions in original image plays a pivotal role to secure an accurate segmented image. Anisotropic Diffusion Filter (ADF) is used in the initial stage to smooth images with preserved edges. Adaptive thresholding is then applied to segment the skin lesion of the image by binarizing it. The morphological operations are applied for further enhancement and final segmented image is obtained by applying proposed boundary conditions in which objects are selected on basis of distance. The proposed technique is tested on over 300 images and averaged results are compared with existing methods like L-SRM, Otsu-R, Otsu-RGB and TDLS.

Nowadays, skin melanoma is one of the most common serious malignancies in the human community. Consequently, automated and robust approaches have become an emerging need for accurate and fast clinical detection and diagnosis of skin cancer. Digital dermatoscopy is a clinically accepted device to register and to investigate suspicious regions in the skin. During the skin melanoma examination, mining the suspicious regions from dermoscopy images is generally demanded in order to make a clear diagnosis about skin diseases, mainly based on features of the region under analysis like border symmetry and regularity. Predominantly, the successful estimation of the skin cancer depends on the used computational techniques of image segmentation and analysis. In the current work, a social group optimization (SGO) supported automated tool was developed to examine skin melanoma in dermoscopy images. The proposed tool has two main steps, mainly the image pre-processing step using the Otsu/Kapur based thresholding technique and the image post-processing step using the level set/active contour based segmentation technique. The experimental work was conducted using three well-known dermoscopy image datasets. Similarity metrics were used to evaluate the clinical significance of the proposed tool such as Jaccard's coefficient, Dice's coefficient, false positive/negative rate, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The experimental findings suggest that the proposed tool achieved superior performance relatively to the ground truth images provided by a skin cancer physician. Generally, the proposed SGO based Kapur's thresholding technique combined with the level set based segmentation technique is very effective for identifying melanoma dermoscopy digital images with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. © 2018 by the authors.","10.3390/sym10020051","Active contour; Kapur; Level set; Otsu; Skin melanoma; Social group optimization (SGO)","137","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042553220&doi=10.3390%2fsym10020051&partnerID=40&md5=21af815f1537da124b591e214ecc3838"

In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e., lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning framework consisting of two fully convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is proposed to simultaneously produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result. A lesion index calculation unit (LICU) is developed to refine the coarse classification results by calculating the distance heat-map.

In response to the ever-increasing incidence of skin cancer in light skinned populations a new device has been designed incorporating both of these methods. The aim of the study was to create a device that is most efficient in terms of hardware and software parameters for the screening of malignant and benign skin lesions. A set of 525 nm, 630 nm and 980 nm LEDs were used to illuminate the skin area at three wavelengths [1] and a set of 405 nm LEDs were used to induce the skin autofluorescence [2]. For a more homogenous illumination of investigated skin area the optimal placement for LEDs in a cylindrical case was found. The requisite spacing from the camera lens was taken into account to produce a focused RGB image. The geometrical shape of the device allows to capture images of skin that are illuminated solely by the diodes without interference from sunlight or other nearby light sources. Polarizing filters were used to decrease glare effects, therefore preventing image overexposure of very reflective skin areas. 515 nm long pass filter was used to enable the 405 nm excitation while capturing autofluorescence images of the skin. Further improvements to the quality of the diagnostic data can be achieved using reference images to track homogeneity of the intensity and then applying a compensating algorithm on the subsequent screening images.

Usually occurring on the skin, early detection and diagnosis is strongly related to survival rates. Melanoma recognition is a challenging task that nowadays is performed by well trained dermatologists who may produce varying diagnosis due to the task complexity. This motivates the development of automated diagnosis tools, in spite of the inherent difficulties (intra-class variation, visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, among others). In the present work, we propose a system combining image analysis and machine learning to detect melanoma presence and severity. The severity is assessed in terms of melanoma thickness, which is measured by the Breslow index. Previous works mainly focus on the binary problem of detecting the presence of the melanoma. However, the system proposed in this paper goes a step further by also considering the stage of the lesion in the classification task. To do so, we extract 100 features that consider the shape, colour, pigment network and texture of the benign and malignant lesions. The problem is tackled as a five-class classification problem, where the first class represents benign lesions, and the remaining four classes represent the different stages of the melanoma (via the Breslow index). Based on the problem definition, we identify the learning setting as a partial order problem, in which the patterns belonging to the different melanoma stages present an order relationship, but where there is no order arrangement with respect to the benign lesions. Under this assumption about the class topology, we design several proposals to exploit this structure and improve data preprocessing. In this sense, we experimentally demonstrate that those proposals exploiting the partial order assumption achieve better performance than 12 baseline nominal and ordinal classifiers (including a deep learning model) which do not consider this partial order. To deal with class imbalance, we additionally propose specific over-sampling techniques that consider the structure of the problem for the creation of synthetic patterns. The experimental study is carried out with clinician-curated images from the Interactive Atlas of Dermoscopy, which eases reproducibility of experiments. Concerning the results obtained, in spite of having augmented the complexity of the classification problem with more classes, the performance of our proposals in the binary problem is similar to the one reported in the literature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.asoc.2017.11.042","Computer vision; Machine learning; Melanoma; Ordinal classification; Partial order; Skin cancer","19","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039720658&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2017.11.042&partnerID=40&md5=940866f5f70d345d0805e716b15a3225"

We developed a validation scheme for careful comparison of fluorescent cancer signal to histology annotation, involving image segmentation, fiducial based registration and non-rigid free-form deformation, using our LI-COR fluorescence images, corresponding color images, bread-loafed tissue images, H&E slides and pathologist annotation. Spatial accuracy in the bulk of the sample was â1/4500 μm. Extrapolated with a linear stretch model suggests an error at the margin of <100 μm. Cancer annotations on H&E slides were transformed and superimposed on the probe fluorescence to generate the final result. In general, the fluorescence cancer signal corresponded with histological annotation. © 2018 SPIE.","10.1117/12.2293847","Fluorescence imaging; Histology validation; Image registration; Near infrared probe; non-melanoma skin cancer","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047727312&doi=10.1117%2f12.2293847&partnerID=40&md5=1a48cff62160cc748e2103c910e7ccdd"
"Skin lesion segmentation using enhanced unified Markov random field","Salih O.; Viriri S.","2018","1","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","Markov Random Field (MRF) theory has a significant potential role in image segmentation field. It uses (pixels, regions, edges)-based on MRF models to detect objects, boundaries and other relevant information in an image. This paper proposes an extension of Unified Markov Random Field (UMRF) model to include edge-based features. Firstly, the proposed technique employs the likelihood function to combine the advantages of the pixel-based, region-based and edge-based MRF model, by computing the product of the pixel likelihood function, regional likelihood function and edge likelihood function. Secondly, the region-based macro texture features are extracted using the UMRF model. Then the edge-based features are extracted using the maximum gradient method to recover any significant lost information. A principled probabilistic inference is implemented to integrate various types of likelihood information and spatial constraints by iteratively updating the posterior probability of the proposed model. The segmentation process is completed when the iterations converge. The proposed enhanced UMRF technique which combines pixel-based, region-based and edge-based features achieved a higher skin lesion segmentation accuracy than MRF model which combines pixel-based and region-based only. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","10.1007/978-3-030-05918-7_30","Markov Random Field; Segmentation; Skin lesion; Unified Markov Random Field","7","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059105166&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-05918-7_30&partnerID=40&md5=9fda1b984e023dca6c2587e86fa6336b"
"Semi-supervised Skin Lesion Segmentation via Transformation Consistent Self-ensembling Model","Li X.; Yu L.; Chen H.; Fu C.-W.; Heng P.-A.","2018","1","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","Automatic skin lesion segmentation on dermoscopic images is an essential component in computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. Recently, many fully supervised deep learning based methods have been proposed for automatic skin lesion segmentation. However, these approaches require massive pixel-wise annotation from experienced dermatologists, which is very costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised method for skin lesion segmentation, where the network is optimized by the weighted combination of a common supervised loss for labeled inputs only and a regularization loss for both labeled and unlabeled data. To utilize the unlabeled data, our method encourages the consistent predictions of the network-in-training for the same input under different regularizations. Aiming for the semi-supervised segmentation problem, we enhance the effect of regularization for pixel-level predictions by introducing a transformation, including rotation and flipping, consistent scheme in our self-ensembling model. With only 300 labeled training samples, our method sets a new record on the benchmark of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2017 skin lesion segmentation challenge. Such a result clearly surpasses fully-supervised state-of-the-arts that are trained with 2000 labeled data. © 2018.

The traditional framework used to classify macroscopic pigmented skin lesion (MPSL) images consists of a preprocessing step to remove hair and shading effects, followed by the lesion area detection and segmentation. Next, techniques are used to extract a set of features from the obtained region, and these attributes make it possible to distinguish between malignant and benign cases.

This may then yield better performance by allowing for networks with fewer parameters that can be tuned with fewer annotations and with better generalization capabilities. This can also allow for interpretability of a deep network, by quantifying attribution to such additional inputs. We study this approach for the task of skin lesion classification, where we focus on prior knowledge in the form of pigment networks as they are known visual indicators of certain skin lesions, e.g. melanoma. We used a public dataset of dermoscopic images, where a low number of feature segmentations and a high number of classifications are provided in disjoint datasets. By including information from learned pigment network segmentations, the recall for malignant melanoma was seen to increase from 0.213 to 0.4.

The size of a medical image is usually large and therefore requires reduction in dimensionality before being processed by a classification algorithm. Feature selection and construction are effective techniques in reducing the dimensionality while improving classification performance.

Atypical vascular pattern is one of the most important features by differentiating between benign and malignant pigmented skin lesions. Detection and analysis of vascular structures is a necessary initial step for skin mole assessment; it is a prerequisite step to provide an accurate outcome for the widely used 7-point checklist diagnostic algorithm. Methods. In this research we present a fully automated machine learning approach for segmenting vascular structures in dermoscopy colour images. The U-Net architecture is based on convolutional networks and designed for fast and precise segmentation of images. After preprocessing the images are randomly divided into 146516 patches of 64 × 64 pixels each. Results. On the independent validation dataset including 74 images our implemented method showed high segmentation accuracy. For the U-Net convolutional neural network, an average DSC of 0.84, sensitivity 0.85, and specificity 0.81 has been achieved. Conclusion. Vascular structures due to small size and similarity to other local structures create enormous difficulties during the segmentation and assessment process. The use of advanced segmentation methods like deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks, has the potential to improve the accuracy of advanced local structure detection.

Skin cancers are the most common types of cancers, melanoma being the most deadly among them. RCM is an effective, non-invasive pre-screening tool for skin cancer diagnosis, with the required cellular resolution. However, images are complex, low-contrast, and highly variable, so that it requires months to years of expert-level training for clinicians to be able to make accurate assessments. In this paper we address classifying 4 key clinically important structural/textural patterns in RCM images. The occurrence and morphology of these patterns are used by clinicians for diagnosis of melanomas. The large size of RCM images, the large variance of pattern size, the large scale range over which patterns appear, the class imbalance in collected images, and the lack of fully-labelled images all make this a challenging problem to address, even with automated machine learning tools. We designed a novel nested U-net architecture to cope with these challenges, and a selective loss function to handle partial labeling. Trained and tested on 56 melanoma-suspicious, partially labelled, 12k × 12k pixel images, our network automatically annotated RCM images for these diagnostic patterns with high sensitivity and specificity, providing consistent labels for unlabelled sections of the test images. We believe that providing such annotation in a fast manner will aid clinicians in achieving diagnostic accuracy, and perhaps more important, dramatically facilitate clinical training, thus enabling much more rapid adoption of RCM into widespread clinical use process. In addition our adaptation of U-net architecture provides an intrinsically multiresolution deep network that may be useful in other challenging biomedical image analysis applications. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","10.1007/978-3-030-00934-2_33","Melanoma; Reflectance confocal microscopy; Segmentation","18","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054068516&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-00934-2_33&partnerID=40&md5=7bd30ec693abeda69325172f22d4bfb2"

Also, an early detection of skin disease can prevent the progression of the disease and save the patient’s life. Early measurement of disease harshness, combined with a recommendation for skin protection and use of appropriate medication, can prevent the disease from worsening. At present, diagnosis can be costly and time-consuming. In this paper, a method for early detection of eczema is presented using modern image processing and algorithms. Techniques such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, filtering, edge detection, etc. are part of image processing and are used to identify the part affected by disease. Simulation suggests that the proposed system can successfully detect the regions affected by eczema. An attempt has been made to detect eczema-affected region with the help of proposed algorithm. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","10.1007/978-3-319-75626-4_13","Automatic detection; Eczema; Image processing; Morphology","4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090256947&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-75626-4_13&partnerID=40&md5=582de77130e5fc7bc68659065c3f8ea5"

"Hybrid two-stage active contour method with region and edge information for intensity inhomogeneous image segmentation","Soomro S.; Munir A.; Choi K.N.","2018","0","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","This paper presents a novel two-stage image segmentation method using an edge scaled energy functional based on local and global information for intensity inhomogeneous image segmentation. In the first stage, we integrate global intensity term with a geodesic edge term, which produces a preliminary rough segmentation result. Thereafter, by taking final contour of the first stage as initial contour, we begin second stage segmentation process by integrating local intensity term with geodesic edge term to get final segmentation result. Due to the suitable initialization from the first stage, the second stage precisely achieves desirable segmentation result for inhomogeneous image segmentation. Two stage segmentation technique not only increases the accuracy but also eliminates the problem of initial contour existed in traditional local segmentation methods. The energy function of the proposed method uses both global and local terms incorporated with compacted geodesic edge term in an additive fashion which uses image gradient information to delineate obscured boundaries of objects inside an image. A Gaussian kernel is adapted for the regularization of the level set function and to avoid an expensive re-initialization. The experiments were carried out on synthetic and real images. Quantitative validations were performed on Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) 2015 and PH 2 skin lesion database. The visual and quantitative comparisons will demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2018 Soomro et al.

Before the skins are used as leather craft materials, they go through a tanning process. With the rapid development of leather craft industry, an automation system for leather tanning factories is important to achieve large scale production in order to meet the demand of leather craft materials. The challenges in automatic leather grading system based on type and quality of leather are the skin color and texture after tanning process will have a large variety within the same skin category and have high similarity with the other skin categories. Furthermore, skin from different part of animal body may have different color and texture. Therefore, a leather classification method on tanning leather image is proposed. The method uses pre-trained deep convolution neural network (CNN) to extract rich features from tanning leather image and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the features into several types of leather. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed method can classify various types of leather with good accuracy and superior to other state-of-the-art leather classification method in terms of accuracy and computational time. © 2015 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","10.14569/IJACSA.2018.090129","Convolution neural network (CNN); Deep learning; Leather classification; Support vector machine (SVM); Tanning leather","30","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049503625&doi=10.14569%2fIJACSA.2018.090129&partnerID=40&md5=bf482eb7846551f89e509742d40d91ba"

The chapter describes the global scenario of skin diseases as well as in developing countries such as India. There are various challenges faced by dermatologists in the identification and classification of skin diseases. These are described with reference to state-of-the-art dermatological practices such as visual inspection, histopathological examination of a biopsy, and dermoscopy. The limitations of these subjective methods are discussed. The need to devise a noninvasive, reliable, simple, safe, and objective technique is described with reference to bioimpedance measurement. The chapter further describes a system developed for the measurement of human skin impedance. Skin impedance is measured with the help of a developed skin electrode. The requirements, specifications, and limitations of the developed skin electrode are described. The generation of a database of Indian skin diseases is described. The impedance of diseased and normal skin is measured with the help of the developed system and various impedance indices have been computed for an individual subject. The need of impedance indices for identification and classification of skin diseases is described. The identification of skin diseases requires discrimination between diseased and normal skin, which is explained with the help of the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

This imaging modality has not yet been widely investigated for this problem and there are a few automatic processing techniques. They are mostly based on machine learning approaches and rely on numerous classical image features that lead to high computational costs given the very large resolution of these images. This paper presents a detection method with very low computational complexity that is able to identify the skin depth at which the lentigo can be detected. The proposed method performs multiresolution decomposition of the image obtained at each skin depth. The distribution of image pixels at a given depth can be approximated accurately by a generalized Gaussian distribution whose parameters depend on the decomposition scale, resulting in a very-low-dimension parameter space. SVM classifiers are then investigated to classify the scale parameter of this distribution allowing real-time detection of lentigo. The method is applied to 45 healthy and lentigo patients from a clinical study, where sensitivity of 81.4% and specificity of 83.3% are achieved. Our results show that lentigo is identifiable at depths between 50µm and 60µm, corresponding to the average location of the the dermoepidermal junction.

Computer systems can assist in melanoma detection, but are not widespread in clinical practice. In 2016, an open challenge in classification of dermoscopic images of skin lesions was announced. A training set of 900 images with corresponding class labels and semi-automatic/manual segmentation masks was released for the challenge. An independent test set of 379 images, of which 75 were of melanomas, was used to rank the participants. This article demonstrates the impact of ranking criteria, segmentation method and classifier, and highlights the clinical perspective. We compare five different measures for diagnostic accuracy by analysing the resulting ranking of the computer systems in the challenge. Choice of performance measure had great impact on the ranking. Systems that were ranked among the top three for one measure, dropped to the bottom half when changing performance measure. Nevus Doctor, a computer system previously developed by the authors, was used to participate in the challenge, and investigate the impact of segmentation and classifier. The diagnostic accuracy when using an automatic versus the semi-automatic/manual segmentation is investigated. The unexpected small impact of segmentation method suggests that improvements of the automatic segmentation method w.r.t. resemblance to semi-automatic/manual segmentation will not improve diagnostic accuracy substantially. A small set of similar classification algorithms are used to investigate the impact of classifier on the diagnostic accuracy. The variability in diagnostic accuracy for different classifier algorithms was larger than the variability for segmentation methods, and suggests a focus for future investigations. From a clinical perspective, the misclassification of a melanoma as benign has far greater cost than the misclassification of a benign lesion. For computer systems to have clinical impact, their performance should be ranked by a high-sensitivity measure. © 2017 Møllersen et al.

"Texture based skin lesion abruptness quantification to detect malignancy","Erol R.; Bayraktar M.; Kockara S.; Kaya S.; Halic T.","2017","1","1","0","0","0","First occurrence","0","","","","","","","Background: Abruptness of pigment patterns at the periphery of a skin lesion is one of the most important dermoscopic features for detection of malignancy. In current clinical setting, abrupt cutoff of a skin lesion determined by an examination of a dermatologist. This process is subjective, nonquantitative, and error-prone. We present an improved computational model to quantitatively measure abruptness of a skin lesion over our previous method. To achieve this, we quantitatively analyze the texture features of a region within the lesion boundary. This region is bounded by an interior border line of the lesion boundary which is determined using level set propagation (LSP) method. This method provides a fast border contraction without a need for extensive boolean operations. Then, we build feature vectors of homogeneity, standard deviation of pixel values, and mean of the pixel values of the region between the contracted border and the original border. These vectors are then classified using neural networks (NN) and SVM classifiers. Results: As lower homogeneity indicates sharp cutoffs, suggesting melanoma, we carried out our experiments on two dermoscopy image datasets, which consist of 800 benign and 200 malignant melanoma cases. LSP method helped produce better results than Kaya et al., 2016 study. By using texture homogeneity at the periphery of a lesion border determined by LSP, as a classification results, we obtained 87% f1-score and 78% specificity; that we obtained better results than in the previous study. We also compared the performances of two different NN classifiers and support vector machine classifier. The best results obtained using combination of RGB color spaces with the fully-connected multi-hidden layer NN. Conclusions: Computational results also show that skin lesion abrupt cutoff is a reliable indicator of malignancy. Results show that computational model of texture homogeneity along the periphery of skin lesion borders based on LSP is an effective way of quantitatively measuring abrupt cutoff of a lesion. © 2017 The Author(s).","10.1186/s12859-017-1892-5","Abrupt cutoff; Contour contraction; Level set; Pigmented lesions; Skin lesion","5","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039709241&doi=10.1186%2fs12859-017-1892-5&partnerID=40&md5=1e9f2adc0a4c1e3b5e5443cf5f46b144"

We propose a set of strategies to ensure effective and efficient learning with limited training data. Furthermore, we design a novel loss function based on Jaccard distance to eliminate the need of sample re-weighting, a typical procedure when using cross entropy as the loss function for image segmentation due to the strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background pixels.

"Development of a quantitative assessment method of pigmentary skin disease using ultraviolet optical imaging","Lee O.; Park S.; Kim J.; Oh C.","2017","1","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","Background/Purpose: The visual scoring method has been used as a subjective evaluation of pigmentary skin disorders. Severity of pigmentary skin disease, especially melasma, is evaluated using a visual scoring method, the MASI (melasma area severity index). This study differentiates between epidermal and dermal pigmented disease. The study was undertaken to determine methods to quantitatively measure the severity of pigmentary skin disorders under ultraviolet illumination. Methods: The optical imaging system consists of illumination (white LED, UV-A lamp) and image acquisition (DSLR camera, air cooling CMOS CCD camera). Each camera is equipped with a polarizing filter to remove glare. To analyze images of visible and UV light, images are divided into frontal, cheek, and chin regions of melasma patients. Each image must undergo image processing. To reduce the curvature error in facial contours, a gradient mask is used. Results: The new method of segmentation of front and lateral facial images is more objective for face-area-measurement than the MASI score. Image analysis of darkness and homogeneity is adequate to quantify the conventional MASI score. Under visible light, active lesion margins appear in both epidermal and dermal melanin, whereas melanin is found in the epidermis under UV light. Conclusion: This study objectively analyzes severity of melasma and attempts to develop new methods of image analysis with ultraviolet optical imaging equipment. Based on the results of this study, our optical imaging system could be used as a valuable tool to assess the severity of pigmentary skin disease. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Conventional segmentation methods, however, have difficulties when the lesion borders are indistinct and when contrast between the lesion and the surrounding skin is low. They also perform poorly when there is a heterogeneous background or a lesion that touches the image boundaries; this then results in under- and oversegmentation of the skin lesion. We suggest that saliency detection using the reconstruction errors derived from a sparse representation model coupled with a novel background detection can more accurately discriminate the lesion from surrounding regions. We further propose a Bayesian framework that better delineates the shape and boundaries of the lesion. We also evaluated our approach on two public datasets comprising 1100 dermoscopic images and compared it to other conventional and state-of-the-art unsupervised (i.e., no training required) lesion segmentation methods, as well as the state-of-the-art unsupervised saliency detection methods.

Computational systems have been developed to assist dermatologists in early diagnosis of skin cancer, or even to monitor skin lesions. However, there still remains a challenge to improve classifiers for the diagnosis of such skin lesions. The main objective of this article is to evaluate different ensemble classification models based on input feature manipulation to diagnose skin lesions. Methods: Input feature manipulation processes are based on feature subset selections from shape properties, colour variation and texture analysis to generate diversity for the ensemble models. Three subset selection models are presented here: (1) a subset selection model based on specific feature groups, (2) a correlation-based subset selection model, and (3) a subset selection model based on feature selection algorithms. Each ensemble classification model is generated using an optimum-path forest classifier and integrated with a majority voting strategy. The proposed models were applied on a set of 1104 dermoscopic images using a cross-validation procedure. Results: The best results were obtained by the first ensemble classification model that generates a feature subset ensemble based on specific feature groups.

The purpose of this study is to explore moisturizing of the different skin layers using 3-T scan. Methods: An MRI of the heel's skin was performed using a 23 mm coil diameter on a 3T scan with a FFE (Fast Field Echo) 3D T1-weighted sequence and a TSE (Turbo Spin Echo) calculation T2-weighted sequence (pixels size of respectively 60 and 70 μm). This study was conducted on 35 healthy volunteers, who were scanned before applying moisturizer topic and 1 h after applying it. Region of interest in the stratum corneum, the epidermis and the dermis were generated on the T2 mapping. The thickness of each layer was measured. The T1 sequence allowed accurate cross-examination repositioning to ensure the comparability of the measurements. Results: Among the 35 cases, two were excluded from the analysis because of movement artifacts. Measurements before and after moisturizer topic application displayed a T2 increase of 48.94% (P < 0.0001) in the stratum corneum and of 5.45% (P < 0.0001) in the epidermis yet without significant difference in the dermis. There was no significant link between the thickness of the stratum corneum and the T2 increase. However, there was a strong correlation between the thickness of the stratum corneum and the thickness of the epidermis (P < 0.001; rhô=0.72).

However, segmentation of the lesion image can be challenging, as these images possess various artifacts distorting the uniformity of the lesion area.

These deep networks produce coarse segmentation, and convolutional filters and pooling layers result in segmentation of a skin lesion at a lower resolution than the original skin image. To overcome these drawbacks, we have proposed a superpixel-based fine-tuning strategy to effectively utilize the characteristics of the skin image pixels to accurately extract the border of the lesion. Our proposed approach not only learns a global map for skin lesions, but also acquires the local contextual information, such as lesion boundary. It can, therefore, accurately segment lesions within a given skin image, even in the presence of fuzzy boundaries and complex textures. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, experiments have been conducted using the 2016 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging dataset, and these experiments suggest the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 IBM.","10.1147/JRD.2017.2708283","","48","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029503511&doi=10.1147%2fJRD.2017.2708283&partnerID=40&md5=9a928dded921854d5c6a056dee1b4776"

This paper presents, examines and compares two different approaches to skin lesion segmentation. The first approach uses U-Nets and introduces a histogram equalization based preprocessing step. The second approach is a C-Means clustering based approach that is much simpler to implement and faster to execute. The Jaccard Index between the algorithm output and hand segmented images by dermatologists is used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. While many recently proposed deep neural networks to segment skin lesions require a significant amount of computational power for training (i.e., computer with GPUs), the main objective of this paper is to present methods that can be used with only a CPU. This severely limits, for example, the number of training instances that can be presented to the U-Net.

Segmentation is one of the first steps in computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancers. Therefore, an accurate segmentation may play an important clinical role. We develop an algorithm that searches for a thin rectangular-shaped region near the image borders that is likely to contain mostly skin pixels. Segmentation is obtained by adapting Otsu's thresholding method by combining independent threshold estimates computed from histograms of different parts of a new intensity image designed to discriminate lesions from background skin. The proposed approach exploits the fact that the object of interest is approximately centered in the input photograph. A cross-diagonal sampling scheme helps to balance the size of the classes when the area of the lesion and the area of the surrounding skin are very different. A post-processing stage that includes morphological filtering and a weighted scheme to select the most salient object follows.

Consensus guidelines are indicated to achieve universal imaging standards in dermatology. OBJECTIVE To achieve consensus among members of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) on standards for image acquisition metrics using a hybrid Delphi method. EVIDENCE REVIEW Delphi study with 5 rounds of ratings and revisions until relative consensus was achieved. The initial set of statements was developed by a core group (CG) on the basis of a literature review and clinical experience followed by 2 rounds of rating and revisions. The consensus process was validated by an extended group (EG) of ISIC members through 2 rounds of scoring and revisions. In all rounds, respondents rated the draft recommendations on a 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) scale, explained ratings of less than 5, and optionally provided comments. At any stage, a recommendation was retained if both mean and median rating was 4 or higher. RESULTS The initial set of 45 items (round 1) was expanded by the CG to 56 variants in round 2, subsequently reduced to 42 items scored by the EG in round 3, yielding an EG set of 33 recommendations (rounds 4 and 5): General recommendation (1 guideline), lighting (5), background color (3), field of view (3), image orientation (8), focus/depth of field (3), resolution (4), scale (3), color calibration (2), and image storage (1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This iterative process of ratings and comments yielded a strong consensus on standards for skin imaging in dermatology practice. Adoption of these methods for image standardization is likely to improve clinical practice, information exchange, electronic health record documentation, harmonization of clinical studies and database development, and clinical decision support.

Lesion segmentation is a very important step prior to detecting and classifying the skin cancer. In this study, we introduce a new method to extract the lesion from the surrounding of healthy skin. The proposed method starts with image preprocessing included image de-noising and removing the unwanted objects such as thin hair and air bubble by using the median filter, followed with edge detection using the Markov and Laplace filter. The current algorithm converts the color image to YUV color space and select the U channel for processing. Thick hair is removed from U channel by combining both morphological operation and median filter. Mathematical morphology such as close used to join narrow breaks regions in an object, fill the small holes and remove small objects. The final step is to find threshold based on Otsu's thresholding to separate the image to two regions one for lesion and the other for skin. The result image is binary image or can be color lesion with black background. The accuracy of the suggested method reaches up to 98%.

A 3-D skin lesion reconstruction technique using the estimated depth obtained from regular dermoscopic images is presented. On basis of the 3-D reconstruction, depth and 3-D shape features are extracted. In addition to 3-D features, regular color, texture, and 2-D shape features are also extracted. Feature extraction is critical to achieve accurate results. Apart from melanoma, in-situ melanoma the proposed system is designed to diagnose basal cell carcinoma, blue nevus, dermatofibroma, haemangioma, seborrhoeic keratosis, and normal mole lesions. For experimental evaluations, the PH2, ISIC: Melanoma Project, and ATLAS dermoscopy data sets is considered. Different feature set combinations is considered and performance is evaluated. Significant performance improvement is reported the post inclusion of estimated depth and 3-D features. The good classification scores of sensitivity = 96%, specificity = 97% on PH2 data set and sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 99% on the ATLAS data set is achieved.

It can be developed from pigmented cells of the skin and can grow and spread swiftly to other organs (metastasis). An early diagnosis increases the chance of cure. In the past three decades, the increase in the incidence of melanoma has given rise to more accurate methods of analysis. Feature extraction is a critical step in melanoma decision support systems. Early dermatoscopic rules (ABCD rule, 7-point checklist, Menzies method and CASH algorithm), used by experts are generally low level features. In this paper, we consider several dermatoscopic rules for automatic detection of melanoma in order to generate new high level features allowing semantic analysis. Such extracted features are based on shape characterization and color and texture features. A neural network classifier is used for decision making. Experimental results indicate that semantic analysis is a useful method for discrimination of melanocytic skin tumors with good accuracy.

A total of 42 healthy participants (men and women; age range, 20-70 years) was enrolled in this study. A region of interest was selected from the hyperspectral images. The results were analyzed in terms of texture using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix which generated four features (homogeneity, contrast, entropy, and correlation).

It is alarming to see the increase of this noxious disease in modern societies, however, it can be cured by surgical excision if it is detected early. In this paper, a swarm-based clustering technique for detecting melanoma is developed. Meaningful colour features from images are extracted, and a new objective function is introduced by applying an efficient and fast linear transformation to detect Melanoma. Specifically, the proposed technique consists of three main phases. The first phase is a pre-processing stage to organize data into proper attributes, while the subsequent two phases comprise iterative swarm optimisation procedures. The iterative swarm optimisation procedures involve a linear transformation to convert the existing colour components into a new colour space, formulation of the Kmedoids objective function, and error minimisation of the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) solutions. The Otsu threshold technique is utilised to provide binary images. The proposed technique is efficient and effective due to its linearity and simplicity. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","10.1007/978-3-319-70093-9_32","Colour space; Kmedoids clustering; Melanoma skin cancer; Otsu threshold technique; PSO","4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035125901&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-70093-9_32&partnerID=40&md5=dcdfd9eb413c6ad598e740b3b893d2ae"

Existence of dark dots/globules is a feature demarcating the melanocytic skin lesions from the others. In this reported research work, a methodical approach for the identification and segmentation of dark dots/globules from the dermoscopic images using mathematical morphology has been proposed and implemented. Different morphological gradient operations have been performed with varying size of the Structuring Element (SE) to identify the small circular structures present in the skin lesion area. In the segmentation stage the threshold value has been selected according to the range of intensity values present in those dot/globule regions. Subsequently, a number of dot/globule related features have been extracted for the classification of the dermoscopic images.

This study presents an automated and robust method for epidermis segmentation in whole slide histopathological images of human skin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Methods: The proposed method performs epidermis segmentation based on the information about shape and distribution of transparent regions in a slide image and information about distribution and concentration of hematoxylin and eosin stains. It utilizes domain-specific knowledge of morphometric and biochemical properties of skin tissue elements to segment the relevant histopathological structures in human skin. Results: Experimental results on 88 skin histopathological images from three different sources show that the proposed method segments the epidermis with a mean sensitivity of 87 %, a mean specificity of 95% and a mean precision of 57%.

"A marked poisson process driven latent shape model for 3d segmentation of reflectance confocal microscopy image stacks of human skin","Ghanta S.; Jordan M.I.; Kose K.; Brooks D.H.; Rajadhyaksha M.; Dy J.G.","2017","1","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","Segmenting objects of interest from 3D data sets is a common problem encountered in biological data. Small field of view and intrinsic biological variability combined with optically subtle changes of intensity, resolution, and low contrast in images make the task of segmentation difficult, especially for microscopy of unstained living or freshly excised thick tissues. Incorporating shape information in addition to the appearance of the object of interest can often help improve segmentation performance. However, the shapes of objects in tissue can be highly variable and design of a flexible shape model that encompasses these variations is challenging. To address such complex segmentation problems, we propose a unified probabilistic framework that can incorporate the uncertainty associated with complex shapes, variable appearance, and unknown locations. The driving application that inspired the development of this framework is a biologically important segmentation problem: the task of automatically detecting and segmenting the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) in 3D reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) images of human skin. RCM imaging allows noninvasive observation of cellular, nuclear, and morphological detail. The DEJ is an important morphological feature as it is where disorder, disease, and cancer usually start. Detecting the DEJ is challenging, because it is a 2D surface in a 3D volume which has strong but highly variable number of irregularly spaced and variably shaped 'peaks and valleys.' In addition, RCM imaging resolution, contrast, and intensity vary with depth. Thus, a prior model needs to incorporate the intrinsic structure while allowing variability in essentially all its parameters. We propose a model which can incorporate objects of interest with complex shapes and variable appearance in an unsupervised setting by utilizing domain knowledge to build appropriate priors of the model. Our novel strategy to model this structure combines a spatial Poisson process with shape priors and performs inference using Gibbs sampling. Experimental results show that the proposed unsupervised model is able to automatically detect the DEJ with physiologically relevant accuracy in the range 10- $20 ~\mu m$. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","10.1109/TIP.2016.2615291","3D Bayesian model; dermis-epidermis; multiple object detection; poisson process; segmentation; shape model","13","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012083507&doi=10.1109%2fTIP.2016.2615291&partnerID=40&md5=0de6cae30dee60ce511a6d917b05e3a6"

Methods: Thirty actinic keratoses (AKs) and 27 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) of 29 patients were examined with three different OCT devices, VivoSight®, Callisto® and Skintell®. Results: Complete data sets were available for 16 BCCs and 10 AKs of 18 patients. All OCT devices were able to discriminate BCCs and AKs significantly from perilesional normal skin due to lower signal intensities as well as a thicker stratum corneum and epidermis in AKs. A significant decrease in the signal intensity and thickness of all skin layers was noted with Skintell® in contrast to VivoSight® and Callisto®. OCT comparisons revealed only slight differences between VivoSight® and Callisto®. Regarding BCC tumor thickness VivoSight® and Callisto® correlated well, histology did not correlate with the three OCT devices, whereas Skintell® showed no correlation with VivoSight®, Callisto® or histology.

However, there is no standard method for handling those images and analyzing them efficiently and conveniently. Objective To investigate the sequential changes of SIH depending on the body sites using a color patch method Methods We performed retrospective reviews of 30 patients (11 facial and 19 non-facial areas) who underwent SIH for the restoration of skin defects and captured sequential photographs with a color patch which is specially designed for automatically calculating defect and scar sizes. Results Using a novel image analysis method with a color patch, skin defects were calculated more accurately (range of error rate: -3.39% ∼ + 3.05%). All patients had smaller scar size than the original defect size after SIH treatment (rates of decrease: 18.8% ∼ 86.1%), and facial area showed significantly higher decrease rate compared with the non-facial area such as scalp and extremities (67.05 ± 12.48 vs. 53.29 ± 18.11, P < 0.05). From the result of estimating the date corresponding to the half of the final decrement, all of the facial area showed improvements within two weeks (8.45 ± 3.91), and non-facial area needed 14.33 ± 9.78 days.

This leads to pulse overlapping and side effects. Methods Automatic laser triggering based on image analysis can provide a secure fit to each successive doses of radiation. A fractional CO2 laser was used in the study. 500 images of the human skin of healthy subjects were acquired. Automatic triggering was initiated by an application together with a camera which tracks and analyses the skin in visible light. The tracking algorithm uses the methods of image analysis to overlap images. After locating the characteristic points in analysed adjacent areas, the correspondence of graphs is found. The point coordinates derived from the images are the vertices of graphs with respect to which isomorphism is sought. When the correspondence of graphs is found, it is possible to overlap the neighbouring parts of the image. Results The proposed method of laser triggering owing to the automatic image fitting method allows for 100% repeatability. To meet this requirement, there must be at least 13 graph vertices obtained from the image. For this number of vertices, the time of analysis of a single image is less than 0.5 s. Conclusions The proposed method, applied in practice, may help reduce the number of side effects during dermatological laser procedures resulting from laser pulse overlapping. In addition, it reduces treatment time and enables to propose new techniques of treatment through controlled, precise laser pulse overlapping. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.06.012","Ablative lasers; Automatic laser triggering; CO<sub>2</sub> laser; Image processing","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976285862&doi=10.1016%2fj.compbiomed.2016.06.012&partnerID=40&md5=20e81eb30ec99c66a235f0c67549a56f"

"Reticular pattern detection in dermoscopy: An approach using curvelet transform","Machado M.; Pereira J.; Fonseca-Pinto R.","2016","0","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","Introduction: Dermoscopy is a non-invasive in vivo imaging technique, used in dermatology in feature identification, among pigmented melanocytic neoplasms, from suspicious skin lesions. Often, in the skin exam is possible to ascertain markers, whose identification and proper characterization is difficult, even when it is used a magnifying lens and a source of light. Dermoscopic images are thus a challenging source of a wide range of digital features, frequently with clinical correlation. Among these markers, one of particular interest to diagnosis in skin evaluation is the reticular pattern. Methods: This paper presents a novel approach (avoiding pre-processing, e.g. segmentation and filtering) for reticular pattern detection in dermoscopic images, using texture spectral analysis. The proposed methodology involves a Curvelet Transform procedure to identify features. Results: Feature extraction is applied to identify a set of discriminant characteristics in the reticular pattern, and it is also employed in the automatic classification task. The results obtained are encouraging, presenting Sensitivity and Specificity of 82.35% and 76.79%, respectively. Conclusions: These results highlight the use of automatic classification, in the context of artificial intelligence, within a computer-aided diagnosis strategy, as a strong tool to help the human decision making task in clinical practice. Moreover, the results were obtained using images from three different sources, without previous lesion segmentation, achieving to a rapid, robust and low complexity methodology. These properties boost the presented approach to be easily used in clinical practice as an aid to the diagnostic process. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.

Methods: A biologically inspired geodesic active contour (GAC) technique is used for lesion segmentation. The algorithm presented here employs automatic contour initialization close to the actual lesion boundary, overcoming the 'sticking' at minimum local energy spots caused by noise artifacts such as hair. The border is significantly smoothed to mimic natural lesions. In addition, features that mimic biological parameters include spectral image subtraction and removal of peninsulas and inlets. Multiple boundary choices borders are created by parameter options used at different steps. These choices can allow future improvement over the basic default border. Results: The basic GAC algorithm was tested on 100 images (30 melanomas and 70 benign lesions), yielding a median XOR border error of 6.7%, comparable to the median inter-dermatologist XOR border error (7.4%), and lower than the gradient vector flow snake median XOR error of 14.2% on the same image set.

To determine the efficacy of these modalities in view of the changes in pigmentation, an objective and reliable device that has a comparable performance to that of physicians is required. We developed a novel photography-based skin pigmentation evaluation system and validated its accuracy and reliability with a newly proposed method. Methods: A novel photography-based system was developed that integrates a consistent photography setting and image processing diagnostic algorithms. To automatically detect areas of pigmentation, the diagnostic algorithms were applied to photographs, which were obtained from 31 female patients. To validate its performance in comparison with the physicians’ evaluation, five dermatologists independently evaluated the area of pigmentation. The clinical consensus area of pigmentation (CCAP) was calculated based on the consensus of five dermatologists’ to exclude subjectivity or bias, and it was compared with the pigmentation area determined by the system. Results: Forty-four photographs with pigmented areas were evaluated by the system and the physicians. In contrast to the individual physician assessments, CCAP reduced the error that occurred due to subjectivity and bias, particularly for areas with indistinct pigmentation, and it was set as the gold standard. The results from the system showed a mean accuracy of 92.1% and a standard deviation of 4.6% in comparison with CCAP.

Even for experienced dermatologists, however, diagnosis by human vision can be subjective, inaccurate and non-reproducible. This is attributed to the challenging image characteristics including varying lesion sizes and their shapes, fuzzy lesion boundaries, different skin color types and presence of hair. To aid in the image interpretation, automatic classification of dermoscopy images have been shown to be a valuable aid in the clinical decision making. Existing methods however have problems in representing and differentiating skin lesions due to high degree of similarities between melanoma and non-melanoma images and large variations inherited from skin lesion images. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new automatic melanoma detection method for dermoscopy images via multi-scale lesion-biased representation (MLR) and joint reverse classification (JRC). Our proposed MLR representation enable us to represent skin lesions using multiple closely related histograms derived from different rotations and scales while traditional methods can only represent skin lesion using a single-scale histogram. The MLR representation was then used with JRC for melanoma detection. The proposed JRC model allows us to use a set of closely related histograms to derive additional information for melanoma detection, where existing methods mainly rely on histogram itself.

In this study, a high-speed, non-invasive, and ultra-high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (UHR-SDOCT) imaging platform was developed for the quantitative measurement of human sub-surface skin mass. With a proposed robust, semi-automatic analysis, the system can rapidly quantify lesion area and shape regularity by an en-face-oriented algorithm. Various sizes of nylon sutures embedded in pork skin were used first as a phantom to verify the accuracy of our algorithm, and then in vivo, feasibility was proven using benign human angiomas and pigmented nevi.

Otsu poorly works for non-bi-modal distributions while Kapur shows poor performance for long-tailed distributions. So, we propose a new line-fitting based thresholding method to detect pigments and pores from a skin image where the image histogram is simply modeled by two lines.

"On the geometric modulation of skin lesion growth: A mathematical model for melanoma","Mendes A.I.; Nogueira C.; Pereira J.; Fonseca-Pinto R.","2016","1","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","Introduction: Early detection of suspicious skin lesions is critical to prevent skin malignancies, particularly the melanoma, which is the most dangerous form of human skin cancer. In the last decade, image processing techniques have been an increasingly important tool for early detection and mathematical models play a relevant role in mapping the progression of lesions. Methods: This work presents an algorithm to describe the evolution of the border of the skin lesion based on two main measurable markers: the symmetry and the geometric growth path of the lesion. The proposed methodology involves two dermoscopic images of the same melanocytic lesion obtained at different moments in time. By applying a mathematical model based on planar linear transformations, measurable parameters related to symmetry and growth are extracted. Results: With this information one may compare the actual evolution in the lesion with the outcomes from the geometric model. First, this method was tested on predefined images whose growth was controlled and the symmetry known which were used for validation. Then the methodology was tested in real dermoscopic melanoma images in which the parameters of the mathematical model revealed symmetry and growth rates consistent with a typical melanoma behavior. Conclusions: The method developed proved to show very accurate information about the target growth markers (variation on the growth along the border, the deformation and the symmetry of the lesion trough the time). All the results, validated by the expected phantom outputs, were similar to the ones on the real images. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.

"Statistical image segmentation for the detection of skin lesion borders in UV fluorescence excitation","Ortega-Martinez A.; Padilla-Martinez J.P.; Franco W.","2016","1","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","The skin contains several fluorescent molecules or fluorophores that serve as markers of structure, function and composition. UV fluorescence excitation photography is a simple and effective way to image specific intrinsic fluorophores, such as the one ascribed to tryptophan which emits at a wavelength of 345 nm upon excitation at 295 nm, and is a marker of cellular proliferation. Earlier, we built a clinical UV photography system to image cellular proliferation. In some samples, the naturally low intensity of the fluorescence can make it difficult to separate the fluorescence of cells in higher proliferation states from background fluorescence and other imaging artifacts-like electronic noise. In this work, we describe a statistical image segmentation method to separate the fluorescence of interest. Statistical image segmentation is based on image averaging, background subtraction and pixel statistics. This method allows to better quantify the intensity and surface distributions of fluorescence, which in turn simplify the detection of borders. Using this method we delineated the borders of highly-proliferative skin conditions and diseases, in particular, allergic contact dermatitis, psoriatic lesions and basal cell carcinoma. Segmented images clearly define lesion borders. UV fluorescence excitation photography along with statistical image segmentation may serve as a quick and simple diagnostic tool for clinicians. © 2016 SPIE.","10.1117/12.2208741","Fluorescence; Image histogram; Image processing; Imaging; Tryptophan; UV","1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978476483&doi=10.1117%2f12.2208741&partnerID=40&md5=85a4c450d37c7cf228c32917939db7d1"

There exists a research trend for computerized analysis of suspicious skin lesions for malignancy using images captured by digital cameras. Analysis of these images is usually challenging due to existence of disturbing factors such as illumination variations and light reflections from skin surface. One important stage in diagnosis of melanoma is segmentation of lesion region from normal skin. In this paper, a method for accurate extraction of lesion region is proposed that is based on deep learning approaches. The input image, after being preprocessed to reduce noisy artifacts, is applied to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN combines local and global contextual information and outputs a label for each pixel, producing a segmentation mask that shows the lesion region.

There is a lack of systematic studies that give standardized information on signal intensity and layer thickness of AKs and BCCs. Objective: The aim of this study was to find out if AKs and BCCs can be objectively diagnosed through standardized measurement of signal intensity and layer thickness and to use OCT as a non-invasive objective method for the diagnosis and evaluation of AKs and BCCs. Additionally, tumour and skin layer thickness were investigated in correlation with histology. Methods: In this experimental study, 301 lesions (188 BCCs and 113 AKs) of 125 patients were clinically as well as dermoscopically diagnosed and investigated with OCT before therapy. Normal perilesional skin served as control. Results: It is possible to differentiate BCCs and AKs from normal skin in OCT due to the decrease of local signal intensity in affected skin layers in relation to adjacent healthy skin. In AKs, a strong thickness increase of the stratum corneum and epidermis compared to normal skin were observed. For the distinction between AKs and BCCs, a drop of signal intensity in the dermis of AKs towards BCCs and a thicker epidermis of AKs in contrast to BCCs were registered. All results are statistically highly significant (P < 0.0001). Besides, a strong correlation of tumour and skin layer thickness of BCCs and AKs in OCT with histology was found. Conclusion: Through standardized measurement of signal intensity and layer thickness, BCCs and AKs can be objectively diagnosed and distinguished from each other with OCT. This will further improve the use of OCT as a non-invasive objective method for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of these diseases. © 2016 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology","10.1111/jdv.13569","","29","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84987875516&doi=10.1111%2fjdv.13569&partnerID=40&md5=ea8833f8608ac2cd098ca11a0f841ed8"

Melanoma is the 5th common form of skin cancer that is rare but the most dangerous. Melanoma is curable if it is detected at an early stage. Automated segmentation of cancerous lesion from normal skin is the most critical yet tricky part in computerized lesion detection and classification. The effectiveness and accuracy of lesion classification are critically dependent on the quality of lesion segmentation.

We characterized skin stiffness in healthy individuals at repeated three month intervals and compared sclerotic to healthy skin stiffness. ARFI and SWEI were implemented using a Siemens 14L5 linear array on an ACUSON S2000™ scanner. A single dermatologist performed all imaging in twenty-two patients. Normal and sclerotic skin stiffnesses were characterized by (1) mean ARFI displacement magnitude, and (2) group shear wave speed estimated using a Radon sum of shear wave velocity data. Imaging was performed at different anatomic sites, including the upper and lower back, arm, forearm, abdomen, thigh and calf. Five repeat data acquisitions were performed in each anatomic location. ARFI displacement and SWEI shear wave speeds were reconstructed in 96% of all acquisitions when the region of interest was exclusively contained in the dermis. Overall, ARFI and SWEI metrics showed no significant difference between contralateral imaging locations across different anatomic sites in healthy skin (p < 0.05). Mean shear wave speeds were >200% greater in sclerotic lesions than in contralateral healthy skin in patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (p < 0.01), and 25% greater in patients with morphea. ARFI displacements exhibited greater variability than shear wave speed in characterizing sclerotic skin, showing a 61% decrease compared to healthy skin in GVHD patients (p < 0.05) and a 19% decrease in morphea patients (p < 0.05).

Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smartphones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analyzing images of chronic foot ulcers is an attractive option. In this paper, we propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smartphone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smartphone with the assistance of an image capture box. After that, the smartphone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the foot is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on red-yellow-black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.

Melanoma spreads through metastasis, and can often be fatal. Statistical evidence has revealed that the majority of deaths resulting from skin cancer are as a result of melanoma. Further investigations have shown that the survival rates in patients depend on the stage of the cancer at the time it is first diagnosed; early detection and intervention of melanoma indicates higher chances of cure. Clinical diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma are challenging since the processes are prone to misdiagnosis and inaccuracies due to doctors' subjectivity. Malignant melanomas are asymmetrical, have irregular borders, notched edges, and color variations, so analyzing the shape, color, and texture of the skin lesion is important for melanoma early detection and prevention. This paper proposes the two major components of a noninvasive real-time automated skin lesion analysis system for melanoma early detection and prevention. The first component is a real-time alert to help users prevent skin burn caused by sunlight; a novel equation to compute the time for skin to burn is thereby introduced.

This paper proposes a new illumination modeling and chromophore identification method to correct lighting variation in skin lesion images, as well as to extract melanin and hemoglobin concentrations of human skin, based on an adaptive bilateral decomposition and a weighted polynomial curve fitting, with the knowledge of a multi-layered skin model. Different from state-of-the-art approaches based on the Lambert law, the proposed method, considering both specular reflection and diffuse reflection of the skin, enables us to address highlight and strong shading effects usually existing in skin color images captured in an uncontrolled environment. The derived melanin and hemoglobin indices, directly relating to the pathological tissue conditions, tend to be less influenced by external imaging factors and are more efficient in describing pigmentation distributions.

The computer-aided skin lesion classification has drawn attention as an aid for detection of skin cancers. Several researchers have developed methods to distinguish between melanoma and nevus, which are both categorized as MSL. However, most of these studies did not focus on NoMSLs such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common skin cancer and seborrheic keratosis (SK) despite their high incidence rates. It is preferable to deal with these NoMSLs as well as MSLs especially for the potential users who are not enough capable of diagnosing pigmented skin lesions on their own such as dermatologists in training and physicians with different expertise. We developed a new method to distinguish among melanomas, nevi, BCCs, and SKs. Our method calculates 828 candidate features grouped into three categories: color, subregion, and texture. We introduced two types of classification models: a layered model that uses a task decomposition strategy and flat models to serve as performance baselines. We tested our methods on 964 dermoscopy images: 105 melanomas, 692 nevi, 69 BCCs, and 98 SKs. The layered model outperformed the flat models, achieving detection rates of 90.48%, 82.51%, 82.61%, and 80.61% for melanomas, nevi, BCCs, and SKs, respectively.

Statistical evidence has revealed that the majority of deaths resulting from skin cancer are as a result of melanoma. Further investigations have shown that the survival rates in patients depend on the stage of the cancer; early detection and intervention of melanoma implicate higher chances of cure. Clinical diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma are challenging, since the processes are prone to misdiagnosis and inaccuracies due to doctors' subjectivity. Malignant melanomas are asymmetrical, have irregular borders, notched edges, and color variations, so analyzing the shape, color, and texture of the skin lesion is important for the early detection and prevention of melanoma. This paper proposes the two major components of a noninvasive real-time automated skin lesion analysis system for the early detection and prevention of melanoma. The first component is a real-time alert to help users prevent skinburn caused by sunlight; a novel equation to compute the time for skin to burn is thereby introduced.

"The effects of skin lesion segmentation on the performance of dermatoscopic image classification","Mahbod A.; Tschandl P.; Langs G.; Ecker R.; Ellinger I.","2020","1","1","0","0","0","First occurrence","0","","","","","","","Background and Objective: Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the deadliest types of skin cancer. Analysing dermatoscopic images plays an important role in the early detection of MM and other pigmented skin lesions. Among different computer-based methods, deep learning-based approaches and in particular convolutional neural networks have shown excellent classification and segmentation performances for dermatoscopic skin lesion images. These models can be trained end-to-end without requiring any hand-crafted features. However, the effect of using lesion segmentation information on classification performance has remained an open question. Methods: In this study, we explicitly investigated the impact of using skin lesion segmentation masks on the performance of dermatoscopic image classification. To do this, first, we developed a baseline classifier as the reference model without using any segmentation masks. Then, we used either manually or automatically created segmentation masks in both training and test phases in different scenarios and investigated the classification performances. The different scenarios included approaches that exploited the segmentation masks either for cropping of skin lesion images or removing the surrounding background or using the segmentation masks as an additional input channel for model training. Results: Evaluated on the ISIC 2017 challenge dataset which contained two binary classification tasks (i.e. MM vs. all and seborrheic keratosis (SK) vs. all) and based on the derived area under the receiver operating characteristic curve scores, we observed four main outcomes. Our results show that 1) using segmentation masks did not significantly improve the MM classification performance in any scenario, 2) in one of the scenarios (using segmentation masks for dilated cropping), SK classification performance was significantly improved, 3) removing all background information by the segmentation masks significantly degraded the overall classification performance, and 4) in case of using the appropriate scenario (using segmentation for dilated cropping), there is no significant difference of using manually or automatically created segmentation masks. Conclusions: We systematically explored the effects of using image segmentation on the performance of dermatoscopic skin lesion classification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105725","deep learning; dermatoscopy; effect of segmentation on classification; medical image analysis; Skin cancer","88","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090043899&doi=10.1016%2fj.cmpb.2020.105725&partnerID=40&md5=cdd09df90e44e9e85a902959618aa05f"

Globally out of every three cancers diagnosed, one is identified as skin cancer. Some reports suggest that one out of every five Americans might fall prey to skin cancer in the course of their life. Early detection of the disease plays a pivotal role in the treatment of skin cancer. Though these skin lesions can be seen without the help of any external clinical device, it is a challenging task to distinguish between malignant and benign skin lesions as they are alike in their physical appearances. This leads to an increased number of unnecessary biopsies where in one study it was revealed that nearly 5,00,000 biopsies are done in children every year to diagnose a mere 400 melanomas. To tackle this problem and help dermatologists in the diagnosis process, we developed an enhanced image classification model which can act as a preliminary check before moving to a costlier biopsy. This model can identify 7 distinct types of skin lesions. An analysis has been carried out on the HAM10000 dataset. We used transfer learning utilizing multiple pre-Trained models, combined with class-weighted loss and data augmentation techniques for the classification process. Experimental analysis shows that the modified ResNet50 model is capable of identifying skin lesion images into one of the seven classes with categorical accuracy, weighted average precision, and recall of 90 percent, 0.89, 0.90, respectively.

This paper proposes the implementation of a medical image segmentation that will accelerate a melanoma diagnosis by dermatologists. In the implementation, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architectures generated by modifying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are used. The proposed algorithm for an automatic semantic segmentation of skin lesions utilizes four different FCN architectures, FCN-AlexNet, FCN-8s, FCN-16s, and FCN-32s. The experimental studies in this paper are constructed on the ISIC 2017 dataset, and the evaluations of these architectures on the dataset are carried out for the first time with this study. In the experimental studies, once the images in the dataset are preprocessed, the FCNs are first trained separately. Secondly, the accuracies and Dice coefficients on the validation dataset are calculated by using these trained FCN architectures. Thirdly, the obtained results are compared. Finally, the inferences of lesion segmentation are visualized in order to exhibit how exactly the FCN architectures can segment the lesions. The experimental results show that the FCNs in the proposed algorithm are suitable for skin lesion segmentation. In addition, it is thought that the experimental results will contribute to the scientific literature and assist the researchers who are working on medical image segmentation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113742","Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Fully Convolutional Network; Medical Image Segmentation","75","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088386379&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2020.113742&partnerID=40&md5=211ac66f9c1c74060359a78d99d90410"

Considering that unlabeled data is abundant and cheap, this work proposes a classification framework that integrates the semi-supervised learning concepts of self-training and self-paced learning to classifying skin lesions. First, accurate instance segmentation is performed using the Mask R-CNN model to effectively localize and preserve the appearance and size of the skin lesions in an image. Then, a semi-supervised self-training scheme that utilizes self-paced learning strategy is implemented to generate and select pseudo-labeled samples to augment the training data. The proposed framework ensures that; 1) the spatial locations of skin lesions are accurately localized and preserved, which is critical for extracting semantically meaningful information akin to classification; 2) sufficient data samples are generated to enlarge the training data to avoid overfitting; 3) a model learns both 'easy' and 'hard' samples during training without necessarily ignoring features from less represented classes.

Burn injury cases are most viewed in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Researchers show great interest to classify the burn into different depths through digital means. In Pakistan, at provisional level, it’s really a significant issue to categorize the burn and its depths due to the non-availability of expert doctors and surgeons; hence the decision for the correct first treatment can't be made, so this may cause a serious issue later on. The main objectives of this research work are to segment the burn wounds and classification of burn depths into 1st, 2nd and 3rd degrees respectively. A real-time dataset of burnt patients has been collected from the burn unit of Allied Hospital Faisalabad, Pakistan. The dataset used for this research task contains 450 images of all the three levels of burn depths. Segmentation of the burnt area was done by the use of Otsu's method of thresholding and feature vector was obtained through the use of statistical methods. We have used the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to estimate the burn depths. The network was trained by 65 percent of the images and the remaining 35 percent images were used for testing the accuracy of the classifier.

Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is commonly used for evaluating skin barrier function; however, direct measurement of TEWL is time-consuming and is not convenient for daily clinical practice. Here, we propose a new skin barrier assessment method using skin images with topological data analysis (TDA). TDA enabled efficient identification of structural features from a skin image taken by a microscope. These features reflected the regularity of the skin texture. We found a significant correlation between the topological features and TEWL. Moreover, using the features as input, we trained machine-learning models to predict TEWL and obtained good accuracy (R2 = 0.524). Our results suggest that assessment of skin barrier function by topological image analysis is promising. © 2020, The Author(s).","10.1038/s41540-020-00160-8","","17","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097786911&doi=10.1038%2fs41540-020-00160-8&partnerID=40&md5=5802871809f4dd496ea65486fbb76619"

Firstly, perform the black frame removal and hair removal processing on the dermoscopic image to remove the artificial and natural noise that hinders the location of the lesion in the image. Then the image after the noise reduction process was deformed and rotated to expand the data set. Finally, a encoder-decoder segmentation model based on depth separable convolution and hole convolution was constructed. The coding part extracts the features of the image, and the decoding part fuses the feature maps and restores the image details. Experimental results show that this method can achieve better segmentation results for the problem of skin disease image lesion segmentation. The accuracy of segmenting lesions reaches 95.24%.

The majority of malignant skin lesions present at a general practice level where a diagnosis is based on a clinical decision algorithm. As a false negative diagnosis is an unacceptable outcome, clinical caution tends to result in a low positive predictive value of as low at 8%. There has been a large burden of surgical excisions that retrospectively prove to have been unnecessary.This paper proposes a method to identify melanomas in dermoscopic images using a convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed method implements transfer learning based on the ResNet50 CNN, pretrained using the ImageNet dataset. Datasets from the ISIC Archive were implemented during training, validation and testing. Further tests were performed on a smaller dataset of images taken from the Dermnet NZ website and from recent clinical cases still awaiting histological results to indicate the trained network's ability to generalise to real cases. The 86% test accuracy achieved with the proposed method was comparable to the results of prior studies but required significantly less pre-processing actions to classify a lesion and was not dependant on consistent image scaling or the presence of a scale on the image. This method also improved on past research by making use of all of the information present in an image as opposed to focusing on geometric and colour-space based aspects independently.  © 2020 IEEE.","10.1109/IVCNZ51579.2020.9290736","classification; identification; melanoma; ResNet50","4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099435088&doi=10.1109%2fIVCNZ51579.2020.9290736&partnerID=40&md5=ad67d58ff36fe95d3ab121f4b9fec784"

However, the generalizability should be demonstrated using a large-scale external dataset that includes most types of skin neoplasms. In this study, the performance of a neural network algorithm was compared with that of dermatologists in both real-world practice and experimental settings. Methods and findings To demonstrate generalizability, the skin cancer detection algorithm (https://rcnn. modelderm.com) developed in our previous study was used without modification. We conducted a retrospective study with all single lesion biopsied cases (43 disorders; 40,331 clinical images from 10,426 cases: 1,222 malignant cases and 9,204 benign cases); mean age (standard deviation [SD], 52.1 [18.3]; 4,701 men [45.1%]) were obtained from the Department of Dermatology, Severance Hospital in Seoul, Korea between January 1, 2008 and March 31, 2019. Using the external validation dataset, the predictions of the algorithm were compared with the clinical diagnoses of 65 attending physicians who had recorded the clinical diagnoses with thorough examinations in real-world practice. In addition, the results obtained by the algorithm for the data of randomly selected batches of 30 patients were compared with those obtained by 44 dermatologists in experimental settings; the dermatologists were only provided with multiple images of each lesion, without clinical information. With regard to the determination of malignancy, the area under the curve (AUC) achieved by the algorithm was 0.863 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.852–0.875), when unprocessed clinical photographs were used. The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm at the predefined high-specificity threshold were 62.7% (95% CI 59.9–65.1) and 90.0% (95% CI 89.4–90.6), respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of the first clinical impression of 65 attending physicians were 70.2% and 95.6%, respectively, which were superior to those of the algorithm (McNemar test; p < 0.0001). The positive and negative predictive values of the algorithm were 45.4% (CI 43.7–47.3) and 94.8% (CI 94.4–95.2), respectively, whereas those of the first clinical impression were 68.1% and 96.0%, respectively. In the reader test conducted using images corresponding to batches of 30 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm at the predefined threshold were 66.9% (95% CI 57.7–76.0) and 87.4% (95% CI 82.5–92.2), respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity derived from the first impression of 44 of the participants were 65.8% (95% CI 55.7–75.9) and 85.7% (95% CI 82.4–88.9), respectively, which are values comparable with those of the algorithm (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p = 0.607 and 0.097). Limitations of this study include the exclusive use of high-quality clinical photographs taken in hospitals and the lack of ethnic diversity in the study population. Conclusions Our algorithm could diagnose skin tumors with nearly the same accuracy as a dermatologist when the diagnosis was performed solely with photographs. However, as a result of limited data relevancy, the performance was inferior to that of actual medical examination. To achieve more accurate predictive diagnoses, clinical information should be integrated with imaging information. © 2020 Han et al.

However, inmedical image analysis, obtaining high-quality labels for the data is laborious and expensive, as accurately annotating medical images demands expertise knowledge of the clinicians. In this paper, we present a novel relation-driven semi-supervised framework for medical image classification. It is a consistency-based method which exploits the unlabeled data by encouraging the prediction consistency of given input under perturbations, and leverages a self-ensembling model to produce high-quality consistency targets for the unlabeled data. Considering that human diagnosis often refers to previous analogous cases to make reliable decisions, we introduce a novel sample relation consistency (SRC) paradigm to effectively exploit unlabeled data by modeling the relationship information among different samples. Superior to existing consistency-based methods which simply enforce consistency of individual predictions, our framework explicitly enforces the consistency of semantic relation among different samples under perturbations, encouraging the model to explore extra semantic information from unlabeled data. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method on two public benchmark medical image classification datasets, i.e., skin lesion diagnosis with ISIC 2018 challenge and thorax disease classification with ChestX-ray14.

At an early stage, melanoma is well treatable, so early detection is essential. However, the skin cancer screening program in Germany has been criticized because although melanomas have been diagnosed more frequently since introduction of the program, the mortality from malignant melanoma has not decreased. This indicates that the observed increase in melanoma diagnoses be due to overdiagnosis, i.e. to the detection of lesions that would never have created serious health problems for the patients. One of the reasons is the challenging distinction between some benign and malignant lesions. In addition, there may be lesions that are biologically equivocal, and other lesions that are classified as malignant according to current criteria, but that grow so slowly that they would never have posed a threat to patient’s life. So far, these “indolent” melanomas cannot be identified reliably due to a lack of biomarkers. Moreover, the likelihood that an in-situ melanoma will progress to an invasive tumor still cannot be determined with any certainty. When benign lesions are diagnosed as melanoma, the consequences are unnecessary psychological and physical stress for the affected patients and incurred therapy costs. Vice versa, underdiagnoses in the sense of overlooked melanomas can adversely affect patients’ prognoses and may necessitate more intense therapies. Novel diagnostic options could reduce the number of over- and underdiagnoses and contribute to more objective diagnoses in borderline cases. One strategy that has yielded promising results in pilot studies is the use of artificial intelligence-based diagnostic tools.

Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for cancer detection and classification is a top-rated solution that decreases human effort and time with very high classification accuracy. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based approaches have been widely used to develop robust skin-lesion classification systems. Each of the techniques excels when the other fails. Their performances are closely related to the size of the learning dataset. Thus, approaches that are based on the ML are less potent than those found on the DL when working with large datasets and vice versa. In this article, we propose a powerful skin-lesion classification approach based on a fusion of handcrafted features (shape, skeleton, color, and texture) and features extracted from most powerful DL architectures. This combination will make it possible to remedy the limitations of both the ML and DL approaches for the case of large and small datasets. Features engineering is then applied to remove redundant features and to select only relevant features. The proposed approach is validated and tested on both small and large datasets. A comparative study is also conducted to compare the proposed approach with different and recent approaches applied to each dataset.

Unfortunately, in many areas, collecting and labeling data is a difficult and tedious task. Several ways have been developed to mitigate the problem associated with the shortage of data, the most common of which is transfer learning. However, in many cases, the use of transfer learning as the only remedy is insufficient. In this study, we improve deep neural models training and increase the classification accuracy under a scarcity of data by the use of the self-supervised learning technique. Self-supervised learning allows an unlabeled dataset to be used for pretraining the network, as opposed to transfer learning that requires labeled datasets. The pretrained network can be then fine-tuned using the annotated data. Moreover, we investigated the effect of combining the self-supervised learning approach with transfer learning. It is shown that this strategy outperforms network training from scratch or with transfer learning.

Alongside with aging of the population, increasing obesity and diabetes patients, we can assume that costs of chronic wound healing will be even higher. Wound assessment should be fast and accurate in order to reduce the possible complications, and therefore shorten the wound healing process. Contact methods often used by medical experts have drawbacks that are easily overcome by non-contact methods like image analysis, where wound analysis is fully or partially automated. Two major tasks in wound analysis on images are segmentation of the wound from the healthy skin and background, and classification of the most important wound tissues like granulation, fibrin, and necrosis. These tasks are necessary for further assessment like wound measurement or healing evaluation based on tissue representation. Researchers use various methods and algorithms for image wound analysis with the aim to outperform accuracy rates and show the robustness of the proposed methods. Recently, neural networks and deep learning algorithms have driven considerable performance improvement across various fields, which has a led to a significant rise of research papers in the field of wound analysis as well. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of recent methods for non-contact wound analysis which could be used for developing an end-to-end solution for a fully automated wound analysis system which would incorporate all stages from data acquisition, to segmentation and classification, ending with measurement and healing evaluation. © 2020 by the authors.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT SYSTEM for SKIN DISEASES CLASSIFICATION","Mohammed K.K.; Afify H.M.; Hassanien A.E.","2020","1","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","In this paper, an artificial intelligent technique is proposed for skin disease detection and classification. The suggested method comprises four stages, including segmentation, extraction of textural features, and classification. The stretch-based enhanced algorithm has been adapted for image enhancement. Then the method of an active contour is used for segmentation to determine the skin lesion in tissue. Textural features are obtained from the segmented skin lesion. As several numbers of the features can affect the classification precision, ideal feature selection is made to exclude features that are less informative and unnecessary. The feature selection is adjusted with a regularized random forest. Finally, the classification algorithms by support vector machine and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) are implemented. The dataset consists of 400 dermoscopic images in total divided into 200 benign and 200 malignant skin diseases extracted from the dermoscopic images PH2 database. The result of detecting and classifying the dermoscopic images on these images yielded an accuracy of 99.7%, a sensitivity of 99.4%, and a specificity of 100% by BPNN. The experiential results confirmed that the BPNN classifier is best rather than an SVM classifier for skin disease images. This proposed model will be advanced to support the skin image processing techniques that provided a more accurate diagnosis and rapid treatment plan.  © 2020 National Taiwan University.","10.4015/S1016237220500362","Active contour segmentation; back-propagation neural network; Regularized random forest; Skin cancer; support vector machine","2","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094944667&doi=10.4015%2fS1016237220500362&partnerID=40&md5=c67437d6d04ee69a8e350c6b383633fc"

"Attentive boundary aware network for multi-scale skin lesion segmentation with adversarial training","Wei Z.; Shi F.; Song H.; Ji W.; Han G.","2020","1","1","0","0","0","First occurrence","0","","","","","","","Because of the large variation in appearance, the existence of artifacts, the low contrast, skin lesion segmentation remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Scale Attention based Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Scale-Att-ASPP) module for skin lesion segmentation with attentive boundary aware. Our network is based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which includes the segmentation network and the critic network. In the segmentation network, we design the Scale-Att-ASPP module to automatically select the optimal scale of the skin lesion feature of the intermediate convolution layer (Inter-CL) in the encoding path, meanwhile, the irrelevant artifacts features are automatically diminished without using complex pre-processing. After introducing the output of the Scale-Att-ASPP module to the same level layer in the decoding path through skip connection in pixel-wise addition way, the more meaningful semantic segmentation is gained. The Jaccard distance loss is employed to solve the problem of label imbalance in skin lesion segmentation. Our network is adversarially trained on ISBI 2017 dataset by the multi-scale L1 loss introduced by the critic network, which guides the Scale-Att-ASPP module learning to focus on the optimal scale of the skin lesion feature. Finally, our network significantly improves the segmentation performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods, especially for the JAC and SEN scores. Besides, our proposed network works efficiently and shows robustness for different datasets. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","10.1007/s11042-020-09334-2","ASPP; Attention; GAN; Multi-scale; Skin lesion segmentation","15","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088396388&doi=10.1007%2fs11042-020-09334-2&partnerID=40&md5=ba33fe89109821241d2c6d02c606854c"

"A GAN-based image synthesis method for skin lesion classification","Qin Z.; Liu Z.; Zhu P.; Xue Y.","2020","1","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","Background and Objective: There are many types of skin cancer, and melanoma is the most lethal one. Dermoscopy is an important imaging technique to screen melanoma and other skin lesions. However, Skin lesion classification based on computer-aided diagnostic techniques is a challenging task owing to the scarcity of labeled data and class-imbalanced dataset. It is necessary to apply data augmentation technique based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to skin lesion classification for helping dermatologists in more accurate diagnostic decisions. Methods: A whole process of using GAN-based data augmentation technology to improve the skin lesion classification performance has been established in this article. First of all, the skin lesion style-based GANs is proposed according to the basic architecture of style-based GANs. The proposed model modifies the structure of style control and noise input in the original generator, adjusts both the generator and discriminator to efficiently synthesize high-quality skin lesion images. As for image classification, the classifier is constructed on the pretrained deep neural network using transfer learning method. The synthetic images from the proposed skin lesion style-based GANs are finally added to the training set to help train the classifier for better classification performance. Results: The proposed skin lesion style-based GAN has been evaluated by Inception Score (IS), Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Precision and Recall, and is superior to other compared GAN models in these quantitative evaluation metrics. By adding the synthesized images to the training set, the main classification indicators like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, average precision and balanced multiclass accuracy are 95.2%, 83.2%, 74.3%, 96.6% and 83.1% on the dataset of International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2018 Challenge, which have been improved by 1.6%, 24.4%, 3.6%, 23.2% and 5.6% respectively compared to the CNN model. Conclusions: The proposed skin lesion style-based GANs can generate high-quality skin lesion images efficiently, leading to the performance improvement of the classification model.

"Computer-aided diagnosis of malignant melanoma using gabor-based entropic features and multilevel neural networks","Bakheet S.; Al-Hamadi A.","2020","0","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","The American Cancer Society has recently stated that malignant melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer, and it is almost 100% curable, if it is detected and treated early. In this paper, we present a fully automated neural framework for real-time melanoma detection, where a low-dimensional, computationally inexpensive but highly discriminative descriptor for skin lesions is derived from local patterns of Gabor-based entropic features. The input skin image is first preprocessed by filtering and histogram equalization to reduce noise and enhance image quality. An automatic thresholding by the optimized formula of Otsu’s method is used for segmenting out lesion regions from the surrounding healthy skin regions. Then, an extensive set of optimized Gabor-based features is computed to characterize segmented skin lesions. Finally, the normalized features are fed into a trained Multilevel Neural Network to classify each pigmented skin lesion in a given dermoscopic image as benign or melanoma. The proposed detection methodology is successfully tested and validated on the public PH2 benchmark dataset using 5-cross-validation, achieving 97.5%, 100% and 96.87% in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, which demonstrate competitive performance compared with several recent state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 by the authors.

"Effective melanoma recognition using deep convolutional neural network with covariance discriminant loss","Guo L.; Xie G.; Xu X.; Ren J.","2020","0","1","0","0","0","Unique","0","","","","","","","Melanoma recognition is challenging due to data imbalance and high intra-class variations and large inter-class similarity. Aiming at the issues, we propose a melanoma recognition method using deep convolutional neural network with covariance discriminant loss in dermoscopy images. Deep convolutional neural network is trained under the joint supervision of cross entropy loss and covariance discriminant loss, rectifying the model outputs and the extracted features simultaneously. Specifically, we design an embedding loss, namely covariance discriminant loss, which takes the first and second distance into account simultaneously for providing more constraints. By constraining the distance between hard samples and minority class center, the deep features of melanoma and non-melanoma can be separated effectively. To mine the hard samples, we also design the corresponding algorithm. Further, we analyze the relationship between the proposed loss and other losses. On the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2018 Skin Lesion Analysis dataset, the two schemes in the proposed method can yield a sensitivity of 0.942 and 0.917, respectively.

This paper proposes the method of fast and automatic segmentation of skin lesions using probabilistic characteristics with the Parzen window (SPPW).
