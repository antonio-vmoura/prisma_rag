Early diagnosis plays an essential role in effective treatment planning and reducing the mortality rate of skin cancer. In this study, we propose a compact deep learning-based classification model with a separable convolutional neural network for melanoma detection. The proposed architecture is aimed to minimize the need for task-specific data pre-processing methods such as noise reduction, artifact removal, and low contrast adjustment to support a better generalization ability for unseen / test data. We validated the performance of the proposed method on the ISIC 2018 dataset.

Dense pooling layers in fully convolutional network for skin lesion segmentation,Nasr-Esfahani E.; Rafiei S.; Jafari M.H.; Karimi N.; Wrobel J.S.; Samavi S.; Reza Soroushmehr S.M.,2019,1,1,0,0,0,Unique,0,,,,,,,"One of the essential tasks in medical image analysis is segmentation and accurate detection of borders. Lesion segmentation in skin images is an essential step in the computerized detection of skin cancer. However, many of the state-of-the-art segmentation methods have deficiencies in their border detection phase.

Enhanced Skin Lesions Classification Using Deep Convolutional Networks,Mohamed E.H.; El-Behaidy W.H.,2019,1,1,0,0,0,Unique,0,,,,,,,"The recent development of machine learning and deep learning techniques for medical image analysis has led to the development of intelligent diagnosis systems that can help doctors make a better diagnosis to the patients' diseases. In particular, skin diagnostics is a field where these new techniques can be applied with a high rate of accuracy. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of skin lesions classification based on two factors. The first is deeply trained all layers of implemented pre-trained models. Whereas, the second is balancing the number of images within the seven classes of dataset used. The state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks MobileNet and DenseNet-121 were trained on HAM10000 dataset. The two models pass through three phases; preprocessing, training and evaluation. Firstly, the dataset is down sampled, splitted and augmented to resolve misbalancing problem. Then, both models are deeply trained and finally they are evaluated against baseline models without balancing the classes. Multiple metrics were used to evaluate our models; precision, recall, F1-score, specificity and ROC AUC. In addition, the micro-average and macro-average of all previous metrics to extend to multi-classification. The accuracy of MobileNet and DenseNet-121 reach 82.6% and 71.9% on unseen testing images, respectively on the original dataset (i.e. before balancing the dataset). Whereas, they reach 92.7% and 91.2% on unseen testing images, respectively after balancing the dataset. This enhancement proves the necessity of existence of balanced dataset for training, to have better performance. Furthermore, MobileNet after balancing dataset has out performed the highest accuracy of ISIC 2018 challenge on the same dataset by 4.2%. For that, this model is the recommended one as it is a light-weight model, suitable for mobile applications used by dermatologists and its accuracy is comparably equal to DenseNet121. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/ICICIS46948.2019.9014823,Convolution neural networks; Deep learning; MobileNet; multi-class classification; skin cancer; skin lesions,49,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083367637&doi=10.1109%2fICICIS46948.2019.9014823&partnerID=40&md5=ba19c224cbcd4941a3291f02ef6dd866
Automated Machine Learning for Short-term Electric Load Forecasting,Wang C.; Back T.; Hoos H.H.; Baratchi M.; Limmer S.; Olhofer M.,2019,0,1,0,0,0,Unique,0,,,,,,,"From detecting skin cancer to translating languages and to forecasting electricity consumption, machine learning is enabling advanced capabilities of computer systems across a broad range of important real-world applications. In this work, we present machine learning models for forecasting the consumption of electricity. Short-term electric load forecasting has been a fundamental concern in power operation systems for over a century. Energy load forecasting is of even greater importance, due to applications in the planning of demand side management, smart electric vehicles and other smart grid technologies. We use two state-of-the-art automated machine learning systems (auto-sklearn and TPOT), which automate model selection and hyperparameter optimization, to achieve maximum prediction accuracy, and compare their performance for the task of load prediction using two benchmark problems. These benchmarks are derived from real world load consumption tasks, namely household consumption from the UCI data repository and consumption data from an industrial office building. Our experimental results indicate great potential for improving the accuracy of energy consumption prediction by using automated machine learning approaches. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/SSCI44817.2019.9002839,automated machine learning; energy management; machine learning; short-term load forecasting,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080962832&doi=10.1109%2fSSCI44817.2019.9002839&partnerID=40&md5=7e88db27885c60e3939d2c4b8e722e44
Generalized lesion detector based on convolutional neural network,Wu H.; Deng J.-Z.,2019,0,1,0,0,0,Unique,0,,,,,,,"In current computer-aided diagnostic systems, existing detection functions are usually only for a specific type of lesion, such as skin lesions, pulmonary nodule lesions and liver lesions. However, in actual clinical diagnosis, many lesions are actually related. For example, pulmonary nodular lesions may metastasize and spread to lymph node areas or other body parts. The detection of a single site is not conducive to the doctor's comprehensive diagnosis of the condition. Multi-site lesion detection can detect lesion metastasis and treat it earlier, and can also explore the relationship between different lesions. In response to this situation, this thesis uses the Deeplesion dataset to establish a general lesion detection framework that can detect possible lesions through CT images of different parts of the body. Compared with the existing single-path computer-aided diagnosis system, this thesis studies and implements a general lesion detection system to explore the relationship between different lesions. This will help doctors to make a comprehensive clinical diagnosis and visualize the results. This thesis based on the Faster R-CNN network model. First it denoises and enhances the CT images. Then, the VGG16 network is used for feature extraction, and the feature map is obtained through the RPN network to obtain candidate suggestion regions. In view of the misdetection of missed detection, this thesis introduces a Gaussian weighted penalty function to improve the non-maximum suppression. Finally, Tkinter is used to create a GUI visualization interface for doctors to compare clinical diagnosis. © 2019 ACM.",10.1145/3377713.3377746,CT image; Faster R-CNN; Non-maximum suppression; RPN; Tkinter,0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081051436&doi=10.1145%2f3377713.3377746&partnerID=40&md5=a9eb28fe76ead7fd0419df3226f81b5d
Multi-Pooling Attention Learning for Melanoma Recognition,Liang R.; Wu Q.; Yang X.,2019,0,1,0,0,0,Unique,0,,,,,,,"Melanoma is a type of skin cancer with high mortality rate. Early diagnosis of malignant melanoma usually relies on the judgement of dermatologists. Recently, more and more research paid attention to classify skin lesion automatically by dermoscopy images, which is able to assist clinicians to diagnose quickly and accurately. However, there still remain some challenges on extraction of discriminative feature due to the inter-class similarity and intra-class variation. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-pooling attention learning for skin lesions classification, which consists of multiple types of pooling operations, attention mechanism and feature fusion. The multi-pooling layer with flexible pooling patterns is designed to capture more representative features. The attention mechanism has the ability to help our model focus on the lesion regions. Meanwhile, in order to deal with the issues of inter-class similarity and intra-class variation of skin lesions, we adopt a joint loss function to optimize the final results. Our proposed approach has been validated on ISIC2017 dataset that provided by IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017 challenge for Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection.

Classification of skin cancer dermoscopy images using transfer learning,Younis H.; Bhatti M.H.; Azeem M.,2019,1,1,0,0,0,First occurrence,0,,,,,,,"Cancer is the second death causing disease in the world. Skin cancer is a major type of cancer and increasing speedily over the past decades. The major causes of skin cancer are Ultraviolet radiation, smoking, DNA mutation and bad lifestyle. Skin cancer is diagnosed by employing clinical screening, dermoscopic analysis, histopathological examination and a biopsy. Early prognosis of skin cancer can help to cure cancer easily and It is a difficult task to diagnosis and classify skin cancer even for expert dermatologists at an early stage. Recent studies have shown that deep learning and transfer learning is very useful in the classification of skin cancer and medical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an efficient way to classify skin cancer using deep learning. We have tuned the pre-trained MobileNet convolution neural network and trained over the HAM1000 skin lesion dataset. This transfer learning method has shown remarkable categorical accuracy, the weighted average of precision and recall 0.97, 0.90 and 0.91 respectively. This model is lightweight, fast and reliable.

Skin lesion segmentation based on modification of SegNet neural networks,Ninh Q.C.; Tran T.-T.; Tran T.T.; Anh Xuan Tran T.; Pham V.-T.,2019,1,1,0,0,0,First occurrence,0,,,,,,,"Skin lesion segmentation plays an important role in automatic skin cancer diagnosis. One of the most dangerous types of this cancer is melanoma which requires an early and accurate detection. However, automatic melanoma segmentation on dermoscopic images is a challenging task since images are corrupted by noise like hairs, air bubbles, blood vessel... and with fuzzy boundaries. This paper presents a framework based on deep fully convolutional neural networks to automatically segment skin lesions in dermoscopic images. Particularly, the paper proposes a fully convolutional network (FCN) framework that is based on modification of the SegNet architecture. In particular, we propose to reduce the downsampling and upsampling layers in the original SegNet model, that reduces total learned parameters compared to the original SegNet model. The proposed approach is applied to segment images from ISIC 2017 dataset. Experimental results show the desired performances of the proposed approach in terms of metrics of Dice coefficient and Jaccard indexes. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/NICS48868.2019.9023862,Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image segmentation; Skin cancer; Skin lesion segmentation,24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082657857&doi=10.1109%2fNICS48868.2019.9023862&partnerID=40&md5=ec2f635dc48a012d0b8289f291f47030
